/**
 * MIXED MESSAGES
 * A short Kotlin program is listed below. One block of the program is
 * missing. Your challenge is to match the candidate block of code (on the
 * left), with the output that youâ€™d see if the block were inserted. Not all the
 * lines of output will be used, and some lines of output may be used more
 * than once. Draw lines connecting the candidate blocks of code with their
 * matching output.
